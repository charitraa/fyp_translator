It is no small task to mobilize the human and material resources of a nation for the achievement of a programme of reconstruction and development. To be successful, 
such an effort must be rooted in the real wants and aspirations of the people and must enlist their full and active support. There needs also to be widespread agreement that the objectives in view are right for the country: that, in addit
ion to being desirable, they are also 
\par sensible, just and attainable and therefore deserving of support by citizens and Government alike. The Draft Five- Year Plan for Nepal aims to present in outline a practical programme for economic and social developme
nt upon which all elements of the population can unite with confidence and enthusiasm. The central purpose of the programme is to raise production, employment, standards of living and general well being throughout the country, 
thus opening out to the people opportunities for a richer and more satisfying life. The scope of the programme is broad, envisaging simultaneous advance on many fronts: agriculture, forestry, mining, industry and commerce: education and health: co-
ordinate village development and other multi -purpose projects: transport by roads, ropesways, railways and airways: postal, telegraph and telephone communications; 
\par surveys, research and many types of technical training; and the improvement and modernization of governmental institutions to render them more efficient in performing their sole function of service to the nation. 
Progress in all of these spheres is of vital importance to the country as a whole and should, as far as possible, be 
\par kept out side the scope of political controversy. It is of course, a part of the healthy functioning of an expanding democracy that there should be disagreements as to methods and criticism of performance. But the basic purposes of development - 
the ends to which the people and their government need to be j
ointly committed these common goals of endeavor and the expanding activities of which they give rise can bring to the nation a growing sense of unity and direction as well as increased stability in the administration of its affairs.

For generation the economy of Nepal has remained virtually static, Until 1950-51,when there was a change in regime, we were one of the most isolated countries of the world, cut off from effective contact with modern influences, which in varying 
degree were transforming the economic life of most other nations. It seems probable that during the preceding century and more a growing population pressed ever more heavily against the means of subsistence, 
and that the living standards of a majority of the people suffered and appreciable decline. In the absence of any substantial compensation economic development, low-level poverty became the lot of

There is in this fact no cause for dismay for experience has repeatedly shown that centuries of relative immobility in the economic life of a nation may be followed by and era of new vitality. Progress is necessarily slow, however, 
during the earliest years of a development programme when attention must be devoted chiefly to the laying of solid foundations for future advancement. During the past five years we have witnessed the beginnings of change in Nepal' 
the advent of a new Government pledged to democratic and welfare objectives; multiplying contacts with the outers world, including periods of study and observation abroad for selected younger officers of the Government;

But it cannot yet be claimed that the economic status of the country as a whole has altered notably, or that a new, progressive trend has been established. The key to economic progress is economic growth, and economic growth is me

idence suggests that the population of Nepal is now growing at a rate of not less than 1.5 percent per year. It follows that production must expand by an equal rate even to maintain the present standard of living.

This is why increasing attention is paid to improved methods of production whereby extraordinary increases in output may be achieved, sometimes increased focusing of attention upon capital formation -that is,

A low rate of saving and investment - or of capital formation -is easier to attain but it means a relatively slow increase in production and living standards. A higher rate requires more self-discipline, 
for it means a greater proportionate sacrifice of present comforts for the sake of increased security and more rapid progress in the future. In both cases the effec

Successful conduct of the Five-Year Plan is inconceivable without substantial modifications in our governmental organization and the creation, as needed, of new mechanisms. For the a
dministrative machinery which we have inherited from the past is coated with rusty procedures, laws, regulations, and practices that slow down and obstruct even routine operations. To carry out a many-
sided programme of national development calling for daily decisions and extending across the country until it ultimately reaches every village. we require and efficient, smoothly running executive organization. How can this be achieved? 
\par One alternative would be to adopt. As one of the major objectives of the Five-Year plan a complete overhauling of the structure and procedures of government. There is danger, however, that so large an administrative undertaking, 
raising many issues and possible controversies, would absorb energies urgently requires for other parts of the programme. A second alternative might be to set up a new, separate organization to administer the Five \endash Year Plan \endash 
geared to action and feed from needless encumbering rules and regulations. Such and attempt to set up a "Government with in a government" having separate lines or authority and separate procedures and pay scales would also. however entail risks-
risks of confusion, jealousies, and weakening of the permanent agencies of the Government. 
\par The administration actually envisaged is a compromise between these extremes. The permanent agencies of the Government will be given the major responsibility for the planning and execution of development work in their respective spheres, 
subject to such co-ordination and direction as may be necessary at national and local levels. New agencies will be created only when clearly needed. Changes in rules, procedures and pay scales deemed essential to the efficient administration of the Five-
Year Plan will be undertaken, under proper authority, in such a manner as to afford, on the one hand, requisite latitude for effective operations and, on the other, to avoid any needless administrative schism. 
The innovations adopted should serve as precedents for general administrative improvements; whenever possible, they should be along lines capable of extension, in due course, to the executive branch of the Government as a whole. 
\par The organizational pattern contemplated may be sketched out briefly. The Cabinet as a whole will sanction broad development programmes, preliminary allocations of funds as between regular and developmental purposes, and annual budgets. Top-
level operating authority will be vested in a Cabinet Development Committee. A Planning Commission consisting of both official and non-\endash  official members will meet frequently to review the progress of the Plan and advise on its content. 
The Government ministries will conduct the Five-Year Plan operations falling within their respective technical spheres; responsibility for co\-ordination will reside in the Ministry for Planning and Development. Within this Ministry, 
a Planning Secretary will initiate and correlate planning activities, review and maintain close contact with all developmental operations; he will serve concurrently as Secretary to both the Cabinet Development Committee and the Planning Commission. 
Technical committees will be attached to each ministry. An Administrative Panel will examine and advise the Cabinet Development Committee regarding all proposals having to do with terms of employment or ad
ministrative rules and regulations applicable to personnel engaged in Five \endash Year Plan operations, procedures or delegations of authority. A special committee will be appointed to advise on the co\-ordination of foreign aid. 
A Finance and Administration Controller will co-ordinate and a Development Fund. Scrutinize development programmes and evaluate their progress, render periodic accounts, audits and reports, and prepare of approval administrative rules and regulations. 

\par Within the district. Badahakims (District Governors) will be responsible for general administration and supervision of developmental activities. In districts where development is more intensive, 
the Badahakims  will be assisted by District Development Officer and staffs of technical advisors appointed by executive agencies of the central Government. These advisors will receive technical direction from their own ministries or departments, 
while serving administratively under the district development officers. For village and rural development work, each district will be divided into Blocks, staffed by village development officers with technical assistants. Blocks, in turn, will be sub-
divided into "Mandals" each with a number of villages, where trained Village Level Workers (Gram-Sevaks) will be stationed to co-operate with the local populace in initiating and carrying forward a varied development programme; 
when problems beyond their competence arise, they will enlist the aid of the specialists at the Block level. Supervising this district and local administrative network will be a Village Development Administrator, 
with the status of Joint secretary in the Ministry of Planning and Development. He will work in co-operation with Technical Committee composed of the heads of all technical departments.

What resources do we have for a programme of national development? The most important of course, is our people-hardy, alert, industrious, and law-abiding. But the educated among us are only a tiny minority; 
our country is critically short of administrators, technicians, and May types of skilled workers. Our material resources, unmeasured and in large part unexplored, are certainly considerable. We know that, apart from the land itself, we have rich forests, 
some mineral deposits, great water resources, genial climate, and mountains of unmatched grandeur. But the transport facilities, capital equipment and electric power needed for the development of these latent assets are almost wholly lacking. 
And our financial resources are slender. To Marshall the energies required for a programme of internal development, and to procure what is most needed from abroad, we must have in substantial amounts, both domestic revenue and foreign exchange. Both, 
however, are in short supply. 
\par No magic can alter these realities. To rely wholly upon external aid would not only be damaging to our national self-respect and our capacity to manage our own affairs; it would also be futile, for in the absence of a strong effort on our part, 
that aid would soon dry up. Only by increasing our own investment in economic and social development can a brighter future be assured. 
The pace of our advance will be conditioned by the revenues that we ourselves can muster and the intelligence with which those revenues are employed. This must be made clear to the people. For without their understanding, full participation, 
and willingness to share in meeting the cost, there can be no march toward democracy and no programme for the nation. 
\par We begin with a handicap. The Government's administrative and defense establishments have grown during the past several years until annual budgets have reached a level of approximately 5 crores (50million) rupees. 
Although economies must constantly be sought, no substantial reduction in current expenditures appears possible if minimal government functions are to be sustained. Because the country is poor and our administrative machinery not yet well developed, 
revenues have remained at a level of about 3.6 crores per year leaving a recurrent budgetary deficit of roughly 1.5crores. It is imperative that, concurrent with the launching of the Five-Year Plan, our national finances be put on a trim basis. 
We have not reached a stage where we can safely resort to deficit financing. The budgetary short-fall of 1.5 crores a year, or 7.5 crores for the next five years, 
must therefore be made a first charge against the increased revenues that will be collected during the Plan Period, thus providing for "normal" or regular Government budget balanced annually at the level of approximately 5 crores. 
Income and outlays for development will be over and above this regular budgetary level. 
\par The total estimated cost of the Five-Year Plan, as now projected, is 33 crores(330 million) rupees. This total refers to governmental expenditures only; it does not include investments in the private sector, which, under favorable conditions, 
may reach substantial proportions especially in industries and mining. We must first see what we ourselves can do, therefore, and be prepared to undertake that much regardless of whether or not foreign assistance is forthcoming. 
\par It is calculated that Government revenues, over the next five years, can be increased by not less than 17 crores rupees if as a nation we are prepared to give full support to our development programme. The increase would come from three sources, taxation
, internal borrowing, and proceeds from governmental services and sales. This calculation is based upon the following tentative estimates, which, while subject to modifications and adjustments are believed i
n their totality to represent a conservative expectation. The figures are stated in lakhs

One is that there will be law and order and gradual but sustained progress in the administrative competence and efficiency of the Government. Another is that the development programme, leading to an expansion in various types of economic activity, 
will in time contribute to a substantial broadening of the country's tax base and in the Government's direct earnings through sales and services. It is not assumed, however, that this will be sudden. 
Projected increases in tax revenue appear only partially in the First five-Year Plan, and then mainly in the latter part of the plan period. The Government it is anticipated will seek to realize progressively a policy of taxation in accordance with ab
ility to pay. Such a policy is reflected in the above table. For example the existing land tax, which accounts for roughly a third of the Government's income, is expected to provide less than 4
 per cent of the increase in revenue required to support the Five \endash Year Plan. Similarly, the proposed taxes on income and on Birta land, affecting upper income groups, 
may be taken as evidences of a policy of seeking increasing equity in our tax system. Land revenues may be increased somewhat in the second year after a preliminary survey of land holdings and rights, 
but the gains shown above are based upon expected increase in returns a full-fledged cadastral survey, to be about half completed during the Plan Period, brings to light extensive acreage on which no taxes are now being paid, 
and provides a basis for differential tax rates on different classes of land. There is popular demand, and general agreement, that taxes must be levied on Birta land. Consideration is being given to a revision of our tax system, towards
 the end of the Plan period or soon thereafter, whereby the value of property and actual produce from the land would form the basis on which taxes are computed. 
The sharp projected rise in import customs revenue is based upon anticipated agreement with the Government of India for direct purchase of excise able goods from manufacturers in India and the levying, at source, of import duties. 
About three fourths of Nepal's 15 crores per year imports from India consist of textiles, cigarettes, sugar, petrol, etc., on which products excise taxes within India average about 20 per cent. As Nepal's customs administration is perfected with 17 check-
posts on the India-Nepal border the above system can be implemented. Assumptions as to the time required, and the rates of duty to be levied, are believed to be conservative. Additional customs revenue to a total of at least 40
 lakhs during the next five year, should be realized from duties on imports from overseas and modest export duties, recognizing that the latter should not be allowed to cut down on the value of our export trade. 
It is believed that the range of commodities on which there are now internal excise taxes (hides and skin, wines, and narcotic drug) can be extended to include tobacco, jute, and other items. A graduated income tax, in principle, 
should be initiated as soon as possible. The experience of other countries indicates however that this is a difficult tax to administer effectively, and that a preparatory period must be allowed for the development of the necessary organization. 
Development bonds or certificates are a normal and desirable method of channeling private savings into the financing of the country's basic development. Some time is required for suitable preparation in order that the country's fi
rst such bond flotation may be successfully carried out. Compulsory savings among Government employees, with assurance of a reasonable return in interest, 
can contribute significantly to the development fund and give to Government personnel a direct stake in the success of the Five-Year Plan. Such savings must be preceded, however by such salary increases as are necessary to fundamental security, 
dignity and efficiency in Government service. Among the direct Governmental operations planned the sale of forest products, through Government controlled corporations. Is expected to yield the earliest and largest net returns during the next five years. 
The estimates shown are based upon what are believed to be conservative calculations pertaining to operating costs and existing or potential markets. Moderate ceases on water from Government-
constructed and owned irrigation schemes is expected to begin yielding returns not later than the fourth year of the programme. The same is true as regards the larger returns expected from the sale of electricity as small power projects go into operation
, and from enlargement and extension of the present electrically operated ropeway. Although the anticipated gains in revenue are small allowance is made for increased returns on telephone and wireless services as facilities are expanded. 
From the estimated increase of 17 crore rupees in total Government income during the next five years,

One of the most difficult and crucial tasks in planning is that of making a wise allocation of the resources available. It is not too much to say that every sector of the economy is affected by every other sector. 
The judgment exercised in evaluating priorities in a development programme, and in estimating the amounts that should be allocated from limited resources to the different categories of developmental activity, must be based on may considerations. Ce
rtain criteria for the according of priority to selected projects have already been mentioned. The programme estimates presented by the responsible departments concerned, and repeatedly screened in departmental and committee conferences, 
must be taken into full account. It is desirable also to weight the administrative experience of the department concerned and its growing capacity to carry out a programme of the distensions envisaged. The long- 
range importance of each aspect of the programme must be thoughtfully assessed. But it is necessary also to consider the contribution of each aspect, in the shorter run, to production, incomes, revenues, 
and the laying of stronger economic foundation for continuing and broadening development. Hard choices must be made. 
\par Concerning one priority, however, there is universal agreement, and that is the priority to be accorded to the training of skilled personnel for all parts of the development programme. It is anticipated that, on the average at least five percent of the
 total five-year outlay for each segment of the programme will be spent for training within Nepal; in addition, substantial amounts of aid funds will be expended for advanced training of technicians and administrators abroad. 
Training costs will be especially heavy during the first two years.

The estimates shown in the following tentative schedule of total expenditures under the Five Year Plan are the product of many conferences and many judgments. But they are not intended to be final. It is expected that
 in light of discussions within the Planning Commission and by the public as well as re-examination within the Government itself, 
the Plan budget for the first year will be finalized and a revised schedule will be drawn up showing anticipated outlays during each of the ensuing four years. The estimated expenditures appearing in the table below are in lakhs of rupees.

 per cent of the population engaged in farming, any programme for improving the condition of the country must naturally be devoted in large part to the development of rural areas. 
Such a programme must emphasize increased agricultural production and consequent rise in farm incomes, but it needs also to take into account other urgent problems confronting rural communities-problems of education and health, of water supply, housing, 
cottage industry, of transportation, marketing and credit, of social and cultural activity. Countries with the most progressive rural extension services have tended in recent years to be oriented not to agriculture alone but to the agriculturist as a many
-sided human being and to be concerned therefore with the interconnected problems of farm families and communities. Extension services built upon such an approach are found to is more lasting in their effects than efforts to de
al separately with individual aspects of the farmer\rquote s life. It is this multi\-purpose approach which is planned for the rural communities of Nepal. 
\par A significant beginning has been made through the establishment of village worker training schools in Kathmandu. Pawanipur and Nepalgunj, and the start of village development work in a few centers. Now a much larger programme must be launched. 
\par Such a programme cannot be developed overnight. It requires an organization adapted to our own rural situation and in keeping with our special problems. It requires technicians and trained administrative personnel. 
To reach all of the villages of the country with a balanced, inclusive programme of development may take 20 or 25 years. We intend to approach the task in three main stages. 
\par The first stage representing the earliest and lowest level of development will be that of local improvement works. This stage will be initiated as promptly as possible in all districts, A sum of Rs. 20000 or more placed at the disposal of each year, 
will be used to subsidize small works of local importance like a road, a well. A school building village hall, park or playground. Villages will contribute at least half the cost and all the unskilled labour required. Thus local initiative will be
 stimulated and the immediately felt benefits of these jointly sponsored projects will arouse enthusiasm and prepare the ground for more basic measures. 
\par Localities showing the greatest enterprise in the first stage will qualify for promotion to the second. Which may be termed rural development. The measures undertaken in this stage will generally be of a kind capable of fairly rapid extension, 
such as the demonstration and distribution of good seeds and improved fertilizers, the expanded cultivation of vegetables and fruits, poultry keeping and scientific protection against plant and animal diseases. 
Encouragement will be given to the construction and opening of primary schools. Vaeeinations and inoculations will be widely provided drinking water improved, and medicine boxes supplied to groups of villages. 
About one third of the country will be covered. With this stage of development, every five years, at an estimated cost per block of Rs. 1,65,000 in the first year and Rs. 1,32,000 per year thereafter. 
\par The third and highest stage is that of village development. In this stage all the previous types of works undertaken will be intensified and in addition, new activities will be initiated. These will include soil conservation, 
greater help in improving farm practices, the creation of health, maternity and child welfare services, an expansion of secondary education and social education, and the stimulation of arts, crafts and local industries. 
The estimated cost per block in this stage is Rs. 2,77,000 in the first year and Rs. 2,10,000 in succeeding years. 
\par It is planned, in a few blocks; to undertake from the outset the broad range of activities normally associated with the second and third stages. This will make it possible to demonstrate to the people the kind
 of development ultimately planned for all village communities, to understand better where operating difficulties and weaknesses lie and how the plan should be modified, to test the kind of administration required for the future, and to build up knowledge
, experience and confidence for the tackling of problems on a wider scale. 
\par For administrative purposes the country will be divided into 150 development blocks, averaging around 200 villages each. Making allowance for transport and travel difficulties, the hill blocks will cover around 200 villages each. 
Making allowance for transport  and travel difficulties, the hill blocks will cover around 10000 families each, as compared with roughly 130000families per block in the Terai. Local improvement works will be
 initiated in all of the blocks as soon as possible. According to plan at the end of five years the rural development stage will have been reached in 32 blocks and the village development stage in 16 more blocks. If these targets are met, 
about a third of the people of the country, at the end of the First Five \endash Year Plan. Will have begun to participate in the benefits of the second and third stages of development. In the light of experience in other countries, 
this rate if advance is believed to be realistic and attainable.

The success of this programme will depend to a large degree, however, upon the availability of trained personnel: administrators. Multi-purpose workers, and specialists and assistants to be detailed by the technical departments of the Go

Year Plan will have to be launched or expanded as promptly as possible. For the training of administrators and higher-level technicians, we shall also have to send selected personnel to appropriate institutions in India and else where. 
This entire training programme must be viewed as a whole and must be phased year by year to meet the expanding requirements of the Village Development Programme.

Poor methods of seed selection and storage have resulted in depreciation of varieties. Plant nutrients in the soil, removed by crops, have not been replaced. A practical programme in agronomy must be adjusted to existing facts, 
including a lack of trained personnel and of adequate supplies of good seeds and plants, lack of knowledge of present crop acreage's and rates of yield. And illiteracy and low purchasing power among the farming populace.

\par Preliminary work will consist of a survey of crops in Nepal and a collection of the better varieties which will be taken to a central breeding station. Much can be done by selection of the better strains from existing varieties. 
In other cases cross breeding is preferable. to combine desirable traits of two or more varieties. In some cases it will be more desirable to introduce new crops from other parts of the world. 
wild relatives of crops will sometimes be used in cross breeding to get disease or insect resistance. Attention will be paid to climatic adaptation and to the efficient utilization of available plant nutrients. 
The central breeding station will require good laboratory equipment for selection and trial studies. Linked with the central station will be eight zonal stations for trial plantings and limited plant selection and breeding work. 
The benefits of this programme, while gradual in coming, can be far-reaching. For agricultural production in Nepal can ultimately be increased by at least 25 to 30 per cent through improved varieties and new crops alone.

appalling losses of precious top soil as clearly evidenced by mud-laden streams after every heavy rain. The  damage is increase by farming on over-steep slopes. Without grass or forest coverage, the soil that remains loses much of its moisture-
holding capacity, with the result of flooding in rainy seasons. The consequence is less water for farming, for livestock, and even for domestic use. And this means lower production and lower living standards for farm families. 
There are to be five soil and water conservation projects during the Plan period : (1)The collection of hydrological and climate logical data, since knowledge of the amount and distribution of rainfall is important in determining suitable control
 practices. (2) A survey of present rates of soil erosion and the amounts of land permanently ruined or badly damaged.(3)

Traditionally land revenues in Nepal have been ascertained on the basis of crude chain surveys of holdings, or by some ratio to the quant
ity of seeds expected to be needed for sowing or to the area of ground that a pair of bullocks would plough in a day or to the area that might be dug with a spade in one day. As a result land records have not been properly kept : 
acreages are not known while titles and boundaries are not always clear. When, as often happens, actual holdings are larger than to registered acreages, the Government loses revenue. Without knowledge of the quality of land-
as indicated by its market values, or slope, or erosion evidence, or suitability for producing certain crops-it is difficult to develop an equitable land tax.

In the course of such a survey lands may be classified and acreages devoted to various crops recorded. Cadastral surveys are important in clearing up confusions as to titles and boundaries, in developing dependable agricultural statistics, 
and in providing a basis for equitable land taxation. Heretofore, lack of trained technicians, equipment, and funds have prevented the initiation of a cadastral survey ; these difficulties must be overcome.

a little less than half the country will be surveyed with maps prepared and tabulation completed. The ultimate cost will be divided as between Government and landholders. The project will not only pay its way but will increase Government'

As experience in many countries has shown, co-operative societies may be one of the most effective means for rectifying social injustices and safe-guarding to workers a fair return on their labours. 
A farmer may work long and hard to produce the best crop that he can, only to find that he must sell when prices are low, in order to pay his debts, then buy back seed and implements and even food for his family when prices are high. 
for this he may have to borrow again at usurious interest rates. If unable to make repayments in full, he may find himself getting more and more deeply enmeshed in debt. If he is a tenant farmer, he may have
 to pay the bulk of his produce or earnings as interest to the landlord. The worker in a cottage industry may find himself at a somewhat similar disadvantage, unable to buy raw materials or equipment on credit when he most needs them,

through which owner and tenant farmers, or town and village workers can combine to improve their economic status, are of several types. The most common because they are the most generally needed- are credit co-operatives and marketing co-operatives. 
Through credit co-operatives farmers may, as am organized group, borrow money from a bank at a reasonable rate of interest and together assume full responsibility for repayment on schedule. Through marketing co-operatives they may put themselves, 
with their combined product, in a more favourable selling position. being able to market their goods at times and in places of their own choosing. Buyers co-operative, purchasing in bulk all kinds of commodities required 
by their membership may achieve substanial savings. Often two or more functions are combined in a single society. Sometimes co-operatives take on additional functions, 
such as the distribution of improved seeds among their members or the building of storage facilities for grain, or the collection, grading, processing and transporting as well as the selling of goods which their members have produced. 
Teaching farmers and other workers how to organize and manage a co-operative society is one of the surest ways in which to help people to help themselves and one another. 
\par Although the ultimate aim of co-operative societies is to increase local self-reliance, organizational capacities and living standards. Government may and usually does play a decisive role : in the training of specialists in all phases of co-
operative work in analyzing local conditions in order to ascertain the types of societies most needed in each locality, in creating an atmosphere favourable to the growth of co-operative societies, in teachi
ng the local people how to organize and administer such societies in a democratic and efficient manner, in providing through state-controlled or state-regulated banks the initial financing required for loans to the co-operatives, 
and in setting up an inspection service to promote increasing efficiency and to guard against corruption and abuses. 
\par In Nepal the fostering of co-operatives will be closely tied in with the Village Development Programme. That programme now calls for the launching, during the Plan Period of Rural Development Programmes in 32 of the 150
 blocks into which the country is divided for such administrative purposes, and for more intensive Village Development in 16 additional blocks. Co-operative offices or sub-offices will be established as a feature of each block programme. Specialists in co
-operative organization will be trained in India or Ceylon, with funds provided through the Colombo Plan at a rate which will enable the cooperative work to keep pace with the expansion of the Village Development Programme as a whole. 
Financing will be provided, for loans at the lowest practicable rate of inters ; to handle this function in all of the local offices of that Bank. 
\par If the co-operative movement is developed in a healthy and efficient manner it will progressively abolish excessive rural indebtedness, contribute significantly to the raising of living standards, and develop among the members of the co-
operative societies versatility, capacity for organization self-reliance, self-respect, and ability to conduct their own affairs in an honest and democratic way.

The present generation in Nepal as in many other countries, has inherited an agrarian system which fails in important respects, to protect the rights and interests of those who work in the land. In a country that is 95

It originated in governmental largesse for meritorious service etc. The problems posed by this carry-over from a previous era are somewhat complex with variations in the status and obligations of the Birtawals and their tenants. The que

such legislation may also provide for conciliation boards and a compulsory sealing down of bad debts. On the positive side active efforts will be made to hasten the growth of co-operative credit and marketing societies, 
which will be financed in part from State Bank or other governmental sources-thus bringing to the farmer at reasonable rates of interest the funds needed to meet his pressing requirements.

now about 84 lakhs (8.4 million) will probably be more than a crore (10 million) within the next 15 years. This means a serious food problem for our country ; even now food is insufficient and under-nourishment prevalent in some districts. 
\par One of the surest means of expanding food production is by increasing the availability to farmers of an assured, abundant water supply through the improvement and extension of pr
esent irrigation work and the development where practicable of new irrigation projects. The agricultural population is familiar with intensive irrigation farming and we have extensive water resources. 
Tributaries from the mountainous north join to form three main rivers cutting through valleys to the south the Kosi in the east the Gandaki in the central west and the Karnali in the west : these each carry a minimum discharge of nearly 10000cusecs. 
Other rivers, discharging a minimum of 150 to 300 cusecs , are the Trijuga and the Kamala in the east the Bagmati in Kathmandu Valley and Tinau and Rapti in the West. 
\par The present state of irrigation in Nepal is not satisfactory. Previously built works-the Chandra Canal, the Jagdishpur Reservoir and the Judha Canal system are in need of repairs. A large number of smaller irrigation systems developed co-
operatively by cultivators themselves in some cases with government help are over\-dependent on steady rainfall supply and tend to be wasteful in the use of water. The 
development of a vigorous irrigation programme has been a lack of proper administrative machinery, this is now being overcome.

One is wide geographic distribution. The transport of foodstuffs in quantity is so difficult and costly in most districts that we should help each to become as self-sufficient as possible in food production. 
Special consideration will be given to works in areas of chronic or acute food shortage. Projects promising the most substantial return on investment in terms of enlarged agricultural output will of course command high priority : 
important among these are projects which will bring considerable new arable land into cultivation. Special consideration will be given too to irrigation works that fit into multi-
purpose river projects involving flood control and electric power production as well as irrigation.

n needed will be distributed through the village development programme : for these the farmers will supply the labour and part of the cost. Major irrigation projects will be in the public sector. 
Experience in India indicates that Government can develop such projects more rapidly than private constructors and being able to balance losses on some with profits on others, 
can select projects on the basis of need and still realize a substantial financial return. 
\par It is intended under the Five-Year Plan to recondition tow of the larger existing irrigation works (Jagdishpur and Judha) capable of watering about 9000 acres of paddy : 
to complete seven projects now under way with Indian and American aid which will when finished irrigate about 45000 acres ; and to undertake additional projects commanding some 200000 acres of arable land. 
The total estimated cost over the five year period is nearly 2 crores (20million) rupees.

Experience in the neighbouring states of India indicates that the value of extra annual produce due to the introduction of irrigation is generally equal to the total cost of the project. 
This is an ext raodinarily high rate of productive return on developmental investment. Yet it is expected that the return in Nepal, from irrigation projects planned for the next five years will be comparable. 
This means that the net increase in annual agricultural production resulting from the 2.5 crore rupees irrigation programme may be as much as 2.5 million maunds (100000 tons) which, at Rs. 10 per maund would come to a total of about Rs. 2.5 crores. 
In addition. net revenues to the Government calculated at a water cess rate Rs.  8 per bigha (1 bigha 1.67 acres) on government irrigation land, would rise to a level of more than a million rupees a year.

There are numerous obstacles to such forestry programme which to be dealt with must first be frankly recognized. There is as yet lack of a clearly defined forest policy and adequate forest laws. An well-organized, efficient forest service, 
dedicated to the wise use of forest resources in the national interest, has not yet been built up. Funds, to date, have been insufficient to employ needed personnel at adequate salaries, and to protect, develop and 
manage the forests on a sustained yield basis. To lack of research and training facilities, lack of transport and communications needed for efficient forest administration, 
and lack of modern equipment and techniques for efficient forest utilization must be added lack of public consciousness of the social and economic importance of the forests and the disastrous effects of past policies and practices. 
\par An early objective, under the Five-Year Plan is the formulation and enactment of a National forest Law that will clearly define policy in the management and regulation of both public and private forest land, 
and provide for an effective Forest Service to administer the Law. The authority of the Forest Service should cover all phases of timber production and the management of forest lands, including the designation of all trees to be harvested, 
the determination of stumpage prices, sufficient control of logging and other timber use and harvesting to prevent unnecessary damage to forest or forest lands, and all aspects of forest research. 
The law will need to take into account the requirements of individual families living in or adjacent to forests : the management and control, in the best public interest of reserved forests, protected forests, Birta forest lands and grazing lands; 
and the terms and conditions under which the cutting and hauling of trees will be permitted. The law will be designed to facilitate the domestic processing of forest products for both local and export markets, thus encouraging the develo
pment of a wide range of secondary industries. 
\par A first activity of the strengthened forestry service will be to prepare an inventory of the country's forest resources determining types, quantity, quality, density and accessibility of forest growth as well as information on prevalent practices, 
and current and prospective requirement. As rapidly as possible the forestry service will be staffed with personnel competent to carry out the Government's protective and regulatory policies. 
\par The forestry service will co-operate closely with other governmental agencies concerned with the extraction transport and industrial utilization of forest products -including the Ministries of Industry and Commerce. Transport and Communications, 
and Planning and Development. For the benefits to the country that can be realized from a balanced policy of sustained protection and effective, integrated utilization of forest resources are incalculable. 
Manufactures from forest products are discussed under Industry.

The Northern boundary is the Himalayan chain of mountains the highest in the world. The rivers arising in these mountains generally run north-south cutting the country into many deep valleys. On the Southern border is the Terai a rich alluvial plain 20
 to 30 miles wide. This is suitable for agricultural production and has a very heavy forest growth. The climate of Nepal ranges from arctic in the high mountains to temperate in the valleys and tropical in the Terai.

The deep valleys and the extremes of elevation and climate make communication very difficult and there is probably no country in the world which has so few means of intercourse between its various areas. 
People living in small and isolated rural communities are cut off from each other. Each isolated region tends to follow a pattern of subsistence economy of the most primitive and rudimentary type, 
the lack of communication handicapping all prospects of development. In some localities there are soils and climate suitable for raising cash crops of comparatively high value. In others there are mineral deposits. 
And some places are very suitable for the development of cheap hydro-electric power. But the lack of a transportation system is the great barrier to putting these natural resources to use for the benefit of all. Without transport, 
administration is costly and the Government cannot fulfil effectively its role of promoting the people's welfare ; the existing exploitation of resources is inefficient and potential resources cannot be developed. 
For instance the forest area of Nepal is about four times that of the adjoining State of Utter Pradesh in India but, due partly to lack of transport the income is much less even though the natural quality of the forest is better. 
In these circumstances not only do trade and production languish. but there prevails a general lack of economic security.

some is usable in fair weather only ; there is a small mileage of asphalt surfaced road. It is thought that to effectively tie together all the communities and areas of Nepal, a total of 4000 miles of road should be built in the next twenty years. A mast
er plan for such construction has been divided into four tentative five year projects. In the Fist Five \endash  Year Plan, 300 miles of metalled road 300 miles of fair weather road and 300 miles of nine-foot jeep able track will be constructed. 
During each subsequent Five \endash Year Plan the fair weather road and track constructed during the preceding years will be converted to metalled road, and a new 600 miles of fair weather road and 600 miles of track will be constructed. 
\par It is difficult to assign priorities for road construction in the first five years due to lack of statistics on trade and travel. Use will be made of the limited data available from the collection of customs duties, 
and surveys will be conducted before the priorities are finalized. As most of the trade and travel routes are from Nepal to India, the alignments selected will be mostly North \endash South. 
During  the first five years further surveys will be made and data accumulated upon which will be based the priority for the roads to be constructed during the following years including those to India and the Tibet region of China. 
\par A policy of progressive improvement will be followed. The first necessity is the rapid construction of a system of moderately priced roads which will give the country year-round service for its most pressing business needs. After this is accomplished, 
the standard of the road will be raised to the highest level that the community can afford. 
\par While it is anticipated that there will be considerable foreign assistance in road construction during the first five years, there will also be internal costs for construction and, especially for continuous maintenance after the roads are built. 
To meet these costs and to augment the Government's financial resources for continuing economic development, various types of taxation will be needed including fuel taxes, registration levies and related fees, taxes on vehicles, 
taxation on land the vale of which is increased by the road construction, and "excess condemn ation" \endash  a method whereby a tr
act of land lying on each side of a proposed road is acquired in excess of the right of way requirements and then resold after completion of the project at an enhanced value as a result of the new construction. 
A principle underlying such taxation is that the beneficiaries from the improved transportation should share equitably in meeting the burden.

The means of transportation into Kathmandu Valley from the South are : (1) by air (2) by the Tribhuvana Raj Path, a motor road in the final stages of construction. (3) by bridle path. (4) by ropeway. 
\par The ropeway is of the greatest economic importance as it is by far the cheapest means of bringing foodstuffs and essential goods into Kathmandu Valley with its population of over 600000.

 when the ropeway was constructed from Dhursing to Matatirth, a distance of 14 miles, it had a capacity of 8 tons per hour. Now, after nearly thirty years of operation, due to wear and tear and the non-replacement of moving parts, 
the capacity has been reduced to 5 tons or less per hour. A year ago a four mile extension from Matatirth to Bhansar was completed. 
This has not been brought into operation because its carriers and spare parts were cannibalised to keep the original ropeway in operation. The ropeway has served the Valley very well indeed, and even now, working 12 hours per day, 60
 tons of goods are brought in daily. However, it needs either a major overhaul or a replacement by new construction. The former would cost nearly Rs. 7 lakhs. In addition, because of landslides and severe erosion which has endangered the tower, four 
miles of the ropeway would have to be realigned at an additional cast of Rs. 8 lakhs. It is believed that new construction would be more economical in the end and would serve better the needs of Valley. A total of 225
 tons of goods are now imported into the Valley daily by all methods. There has been a normal yearly increase of about 10 tons per day. With new economic development the rate of increase may be substantially accelerated. 
Considering this it is proposed to construct an entirely new ropeway with a capacity of 20 tons per hour. This would greatly decrease the cost of transporting goods to and from Kathmandu Valley. 
\par The bulk of the goods now coming from India are transferred from the Indian meter-gauge railroad at Raxaul to the Nepal narrow gauge railroad, thence shipped to Amlekhgang from where they are transferred again to trucks and brought by road to Dhursing, 
the terminus of the ropeway. Under the section on Railroads, below it is proposed to change the present narrow gauge railway to meter gauge and to extend it to Hitaura. When this is assured the new 20
 tons per hour ropeway should be extended to Hitaura so that goods could be brought to Kathmandu from India with only one transfer, from railway to ropeway at Hitaura. Alternatively, if necessary the Kathamandu Hitaura, 
ropeway might be extended to Amlekhganj. 
\par When replaced, the existing ropeway can be salvaged, and in smaller sections can be used in several places in Nepal that greatly need this means of transportation. The replacement of the present line will thus not only be of advantage to Kathmandu Valley
, but also to other places where sections of this line will be used. As power will be made available at many places during the next five years there should be no difficulty in working these ropeways after they have been installed.

The condition of the railway is reasonably good when the lack of maintenance and materials is taken into consideration . 
The goods traffic is steadily increasing and it is not anticipated that the railroad can take care of continuing enlargement of traffic without improvement. an Indian Railway officer's delegation inspected the above railway in 1952
 and listed five courses of possible action: (1) Rehabilitation of the present line at minimum expenses, estimated cost Rs. 17 laks. (2)Rehabilitation as a permanent measure estimated cost, 41.5 lakhs (3) Conversion of th
e present line from narrow gauge to meter gauge, estimated cost at 3.25 lakhs per mile, Rs 105 laks excluding rolling stock, workshop equipment. (4) Extension of the narrow gauge line to Hitaura after rehabilitating the existing line, estimated cost, 
including additional rolling stock, Rs 191.5 Lakhs.(5) Conversion of the existing narrow gauge line, then extending the meter gauge line to Hitaura ; estimated cost (a) conversion of present line to meter gauge. Rs. 105 lakhs (as in 3 above), and (b) 
construction of 25 miles extension to Hitaura at 9 lakhs per mile Rs. 225 lakhs \endash total 330 lakhs. 
\par The fifth alternative was recommended for many reasons; to eliminate transhipment at Raxaul ; to provide increased carrying capacity to meet increased demand : to provide through train service to meter gauge connections in India : to export raw materials
, forest products, ballast, lime and other products to India at cheaper rates to competitive markets' to standardize maintenance and by uniformity with nearby Indian railways, to encourage and development of our railway, lessen transport costs, 
facilitate training of personnel, and expedite procurement of equipment and spare parts. 
\par In addition, the railhead at Hitaura would link up with the proposed extended ropeway to Kathmandu, which would greatly facilitate the shipment of goods from India to Kathmandu as well as greatly reduce the shipping costs. 
Instead of having the three transjo[,emt [pomts at Raxai;. Amlekhganj and Dhursing , we shall have but one at Hitaura. 
\par At Hitaura the line would more easily serve also the Rapti Valley which is under extensive development, and would be come an important junction fort the export from Nepal of fores products, cement and other goods.

New construction during the period of the Five-Year Plan as well as improvements in existing facilities, will be phased in accordance with priority needs and availabilities of equipment and trained personnel. 
A tentative schedule for the full period has been developed. New automatic exchanges (100 lines each) are planned for Biratnagar and Birgunj and also (50 lines each) for Janakpur and Rajbiraj. In Kathmandu 300 lines will be added to the present C.
B exchange and a new 100 line automatic exchange installed in these cretariat ; the latter will be an important aid to more efficient administration. New telephone offices are planned for Bhairawa Jayanagar, Nepalganj, and Rangeli (Morang). 
Existing trunk lines will be transposed where necessary and improved with repeater mechanisms, towers for river crossings, etc. A duplicate line wil be constructed from Kathmandu to Birganj (as well as a telegraph line) 
another from Kathmandu to Biratnagar, Dharan and Dhankuta; a new line from Bhairawa to Tawalihawa and another new line from Bhairawa to Parasi. 
\par The personnel required to carry out the new construction and to man the expanded system will be trained according to plan adjusted to the anticipated rate of demand. 
Junior technicians will be trained as far as possible in Kathmandu while engineers and senior technicians will be trained abroad in the best modern techniques and practices.

The obstacles to any dramatic exploitation of this vast resource during the next few years, however, should be recognized. The best sites for power dams are often in remote localities to which transport facilities are practically non \endash existent. 
The initial investment required for sizeable projects is heavy. The potential market for electricity in most parts of the country is limited by the low purchasing power of the people. 
Before power generating projects can be undertaken there is need for an accumulation of meteorological and hydrological data, for personnel competent to conduct through pre-investment engineering and economic surveys, 
for adequate financing and a well staffed organization to plan and carry out construction, and for and agency-public or private- to handle distribution of the poser generated. These, to a large extent, are lacking in Nepal. We are not 
in a position now to launch any massive hydr0-electric schemes. 
\par What we undertake during the next few years must be adjusted to realistically assessed markets and costs and to actual availability's (directly or through aid programmes) in personnel, finance, transport and organization. Generally speaking, 
we shall need to follow a policy of generating power in relatively small-scale installations when and where required rather than to attempt " grid systems" involving high initial investment including wide power line distribution, 
although present construction may fit into such systems years hence. Our internal markets for electricity in the near future are likely to be valley and plain communities and hill towns where not-too-distant power \endash generating units
 can be units can be built with modest capital to service small \endash  scale and medium industries and to meet effective household and community demands. Rural electrification where feasible, may stimulate an expansion in small-
scale and even cottage industries, to the benefit of living standards in the area.

Completion of the above programme within the Plan Period would add around 20,000 kilowatts to the country's total installed capacity about half to this amount being in Eastern Nepal, 
is a third in Kathmandu Valley and the balance distributed is among Rapti Valley, Pokhara Valley, perhaps the Birganj area and the Bahairawa-Palpa area. 
\par The kosi Project, in the Rajbiraj Morong area, is intended to provide power to parts of both eastern Neapl and northern India, and is associated with irrigation and flood control measures of interest to both countries. 
It is being conducted by India under an agreement by which Nepal is to receive 10,000 k.w. at the power houses, free of cost, for use within Nepal. Aside from Biratnagar, which is expected to consume about 2,500 k.w, 
the market potentiality for electricity in eastern Nepal has not year been evaluated, but it is presumed that both hill and Teria districts east of Kathmandu would themselves of this electric power. 
\par The Trisuli Project, for which survey has been completed, would be near Trisuli Bazar in District West No. 1 It would provide power to Kathmandu and Rati Valleys and, if the transmission line is extended, to the Birganj area. 
The scheme would involve a diversion of the Trisuli River (minimum flow, 10,000 cusecs) and exploitation of a consequent drop of 150 feet. The Bagmati Project, now being surveyed, would be about five miles from Makawanpur Garhi, 
suitably situated to supply the same three areas as would the Trisuli Project, Somewhat smaller but more accessible than the Trisuli Project, it would use a fall of about 400 feet in a 3-mile stretch of the Bagmati River which has a minimum flow of about 
200 cusecs. 
\par The Tharo Project, about 10 miles from Kathmandu along the trail to Bhimphedi, had had a preliminary survey. It would utilize the flow of the Tharo Khola (minimum flow of 7.5 cusecs)through a fall of 700 feet between Mahavir and Kharikoboat. 
The plant could easily be connected with the Pharping power house by using an existing transmission line from the latter to the Ropeway at a point near the Tharo Project. 
\par The Seti Project would be very near the town of Pokhara where the Seti River cuts through a gorge about 250 feet deep and not more than 30 feet wide, with a minimum flow of about 200 cubic feet per second. 
The ultimate capacity of the project would be about 4,000 k.w but the construction will be phased since the initial demand at Pokhara is expected to rather limited. 
\par The Tinau Project, in the vicinity of Butwal which is on the way from the Nautunuwa railhead to Palpa, would meet the demand for electricity from people of the Bhairw- Palpa area. The sources used could ultimately be tapped for 3,000 k.w. or more. 
\par Detailed surveys covering all of the above projects will be completed as promptly as possible. Technicians required for each project would include, with minor variations and executive engineer, 3 assistant engineers, 12 supervisors or overseers, 
a computer, a draftsman, and a stenographer. Until our own specialists can be trained in sufficient number, we shall use with appreciation technical skills and guidance provided through the aid programmes. 
\par During the Plan period, selected young men will be sent abroad, on a pre-arranged schedule, for technical training at all requisite levels in order that, as soon as practicable, they may come back for short periods of work with the foreign experts, then b
e in a position to take over responsibility for efficient operation and maintenance of power installation and, in due course, for the direction of new construction projects.

The cost of power units of 30 to 40 k.w. would average about 30 to 40 k.w would average about 50,000 rupees : distribution costs would be low and the local people would have the pride of owning these small power units. The cost of a hundred su
ch units would be only 50 lakhs rupees and power could be generated locally at a hundred different places and the benefits of electricity could be spread to a considerable part of the population over a wide area. 
Due to the high cost of transporting kerosene oil and a lack of vegetable oil, people in the hills generally remain in darkness after sunset. Electricity would be a boon which they would immediately appreciate. The one hundred plants, more or less, 
could be constructed quickly whereas a big plant requires several years. For all of these reasons, serious consideration will be given to the making of adjustments in the above schedule for larger projects in order that, within the total budget approved, 
at least a substantial number of the 30 to 40 k.w power units may be set up in well-distributed rural districts.

Consideration will be given to the recommendation that a Special Power Board should be established under the terms of the Development Board Act, to ensure coordinated thinking and decisions on 
policy matters and to facilitate maximum economy and efficiency in operations. Problems on which the Board would provide high-level guidance would include the possibility  of increased emphasis upon small rural power units, 
the role of private enterprise in the electricity field-especially in the handling of distribution, the possibilities (which may be considerable)of development of power for export, 
and legislation required in order to put the development and use of electric power in Nepal on the basis that will best serve the immediate and longer-range interests of the entire nation.

Until recent years Nepalese communities depended very largely, for fabricated goods, upon the products of cottage industries. Only in the last twenty years have we had experience with small and medium-sized factories using non-human sources of power. 
Successful operation of some of the earlier enterprises was followed by a period of opportunistic expansion during which many ill-considered ventures were launched without proper preparation, financing, management, 
and knowledge of industrial processes and marketing potentialities. But these enterprises were also handicapped by lack of environmental conditions conducive to normal industrial growth-lack of transport, of readily accessible markets, 
of scientific and technical education of commercial statistics and publication of banking and credit institutions, of accumulated industrial experience, of protective and regulatory legislation. It is not wholly surprising therefore that Nepal's industri

In considering what needs to be done to put industrial growth on a sound footing, it is well to note at the outset that many factors determine the capacity of manufacturing enterprises-large or small \endash 
 to produce efficiently and to survive in a competitive world. These factors include managerial competence, entrepreneurial initiative, technology, labor skills, co-operative labor management relations, 
availability and quality of raw materials auxiliary services such as transport and power, banking and credit and insurance facilities, business research institutions, educational facilities for the training of speciali
zed personnel and Governmental policies or activities pertaining to taxation tariffs currency management, or guidance of investment. 
\par Because industrial growth depends upon many interrelated factors, the earliest phases of industrial development are nearly always the most difficult. It is necessary to bear in mind constantly, and adjust to both internal and environmental influences. 
Once well begun, however the process of industrialization tend gradually to gain momentum through the interaction of dynamic influences. 
Each significant improvement in productivity and incomes for example may exert a favorable influence upon internal markets and upon the volume of savings available for future investment. And the successful launching of some industries tends to i
mprove the environment for others in terms of public confidence, investment, cumulative skills, and availability of auxiliary services. It is most important; however, that the industries selected for early encouragement should be successful. 
\par In determining which industries will receive major attention under the Five-Year Plan priorities will be based upon assessment of which projects are best suited to a balancing of the economy are found to be feasible, 
and can be implemented most readily with available means-raw materials, labor force, and financial resources. 
Specific objectives and targets will be set only after surveys and research provide the data essential for making such determinations in regard to specific industrial plants. General objectives to be borne in mind, 
will include a revival and expansion of cottage industries selected on the basis of their quality and capacity to survive; encouragement to private savings and investment in productive enterprises, and of foreign capital under appropriate safeguards, 
assistance to existing industries requiring help when there is a basis for reasonable confidence in the future soundness of the enterprise; intensification of surveys and research essential to wise planning; fostering technological training, te
chnological advances in production, and a discriminating use of foreign technical aid; a broadening of the channels of communication and understanding between Government and Industry ; study and recommendations on needed legislation : 
and the maintenance of close working relations among all departments of the Government concerned directly or indirectly with problems relating to industrial development. 
\par Determination as to which industries will fall into the public and which into the private sector will be based upon practical rather than theoretical considerations, taking into account the degree of public interest involved, 
the availability of investment funds, available managerial talent, and similar factors, it is expected that transport, communications, hydroelectric power, and large irrigation projects will be governmentally owned and operated. 
Forest products may be handled partly by State owned corporations. Industries in the private sector will be accorded treatment and facilities no less favorable than those given to public enterprises. 
Subject to through going study and analysis before decisions are reached, priority consideration will be given to industries for the production of cement, forest products, sugar, textiles, cigarettes, and iron. For cottage industries, training-cum 
\endash production centers will be created in different parts of the country, at least one each year-to develop and improve designs, quality production, and skills. Small loans will be made to trainees to start their own operations on
 an individual or cooperative basis, and they will be sold tools and machines on installment payment terms. They will be helped in procuring raw materials economically and in marketing their finished products.

The importance of minerals for the production of a host of tools, implements, utensils and other producers' and consumers' goods is generally understood as is the significance of such production in meeting problems of unemployment, transport, 
communications, and diversification of the economy. Fragmentary historical evidence indicates the past existence in Nepal of mining copper, iron and other minerals. The decline and e
xtinction of such enterprises as existed is attributed to transport problem and to ruthless treatment of workers which caused them to loses interest. That Nepalese people can be interested in such work today, however, 
and that they can succeed at it is indicated by numbers who have taken employment and done very well in mining enterprises of nearby countries. 
\par In much popular thinking the vast mountains of Nepal are believed to contain extensive mineral resources. But in the aeons of geological time the pre
sent Himalayas are believed to be of relatively late origin and the gradual upheavals that brought about their formation on the earth's crust may have broken up or buried deep some previously existing deposits. 
The full facts are not known and cannot be known until extensive exploratory and investigative work has been done. There are several stages or aspects in the making of determinations as to the size and quality of mineral deposits. 
One is geological reconnaissance formations of the area. This information may be useful in indicating where the next stage can best be initiated - the stage of exploring for actual mineral deposits of potential commercial value. 
Such exploration may be conducted by a combination of methods including detailed geological studies, the analysis of rocks in the vicinity, test drillings, etc. After the presence of a mineral deposit has been confirmed, 
it is important to determine its probable extent and its relative equality and purity. This may be done by further drillings and by laboratory analysis of samples brought in for scientific testing. 
\par In Nepal we have entered upon the preliminary stages of such work, with help from a few experts of the United Nations Technical Assistance Administration, the Geological Survey of India, and the United States Operations Mission. 
A first basic geological reconnaissance survey and mapping of the mountain formations of Nepal, which has been going on for several years, is now nearing completion. Several field geologists have been at work more re
cently to ascertain the existence and extent of certain possible mineralized zones. Simple laboratory facilities for chemical and metallurgical analysis of samples have been initiated. What has been done so far, however, 
represents only the barest beginning of what is needed. Continuation of such work over a period of many years is needed and must be followed up by practical searches for mineral deposits of economic value. 
For this it is desirable to have both systematic searches employing modern techniques of mineral exploration and country-wide searches following prospector methods. 
\par Some deposits have been identified and investigations of their extent and quality have been, or soon will be, started. It now appears to be well established that a limestone d
eposit at Bhainse is large and of satisfactory quality for the manufacture of cement. Preliminary study has indicated that an iron deposit at Phulchowki-danda is sizable; deep diamond drillings are now projected to ascertain the actual extent. 
formation and quality. Nangre copper and Bhorle nickel are to be further investigated. A mica deposit north of Kathmandu appears to be sufficient to warrant commercial mining, 
while lignite deposits also near Kathmandu may prove to be suitable for firing brick kilns and for fuel in other uses not requiring higher-grade coal. Deposits of the latter have not been confirmed in any significant quantity in accessible areas; 
coal is so important for many uses including foundry and metallurgical work that priority will be given to the exploration of any suspected deposits. 
Other minerals known to exist in Nepal but without any knowledge as to whether the amounts are commercially promising are cobalt, lead and zinc. 
\par After deposits are established in quantity and quality to justify mining operations, a number of obstacles or problems must be assessed or dealt with. The possibility of economic transportations to and from the deposit must be determined. 
Answers must be found as to the availability of coal, power or other auxiliary services or, alternatively, as to the economic soundness of mining and smelting operations without such resources and facilities. 
Technically competent personnel must be available to conduct the mining operations and to merchandise the product. And before
 the work can commence there must be sufficient investment funds and capital equipment from either private or public sources to see the project through to the point where it can pay its own way. 
\par Each of these questions will be the subject of study and action under the Five-Year Plan. Co-ordination will be maintained between the Bureau of Mining and other departments including those of Transport, Communications, Industry, Agriculture, 
Village Development, Education, Power and , of course, Planning and development. The work of foreign experts made available through aid programmes will be more closely integrated through consultations initiated by the Bureau of Mining; 
this will forestall duplication and make for more effective use of availability of maps, records and equipment. It will also ensure more thorough, considered planning of further operations. Special emphasis will be placed upon the training, 
at suitable places abroad, of mining engineers and other higher-grade technical personnel, support will be given to the training of lower-level technicians within Nepal. 
Efforts will be made to enlist the interest of private capital in promising ventures capable of development through private enterprise; encouragement may be given through public loan funds. In s
ome cases direct governmental participation in ownership and operation may be indicated, in which event public corporations with some private participation may be organized.

To deal with major policy decisions in relation to minerals and mining, to help in the establishment of a mining code, and to advice on the formulation of needed regulatory legislation, 
the Bureau of Mines will avail itself of expert counsel within the Government and among the aid organizations. A special board will be set up, according to present plans, to make loans to prospectors and mining ventures,

The main determinant of Nepal's commerce - its history, pattern, composition and volume - has been geography. Ridges stretching southward from Himalayan highlands to the lowlands of the Terai have interposed lofty deterrants to east-
west trade within the country, an effect reinforced by un-bridged rivers flowing southward into India. Rugged terrain throughout the greater part of the country has been a sever obstacle to even north-south commerce, internal and external. 
But the trade channedl that have exited - within the country and through a few high passes into the Tibet region of China, and across the flat 500 mile Indian frontier - are largely north to south channels. 
\par Until recent years goods north of the Terai were carried almost exclusively by men and by pack animals along narrow and sometimes dangerous mountain trails. Products of the hill country, along with salt, wool and other items from Tibet found their way to
 the midland valleys and the Terai and beyond, while agricultural products from the Terai and manufactured goods from India and overseas followed the reverse route. According to popular belief Nepal enjoyed a flourishing entrepot trade. 
Being the immediate source for Tibet of rice, sugar, tea, amber, turquoise, coral, brocades and many other items, Nepal was called by Tibetans }{\fcs1 \ai\af0\afs19 \fcs0 \i\fs19\insrsid1074980 Bhayul}{\fcs1 \af0\afs19 \fcs0 \fs19\insrsid1074980 , the "
land of plenty". And through Nepal to the outer world went Tibetan rugs and blankets, hides and skins, yaktails and other products. 
\par As a land-locked nation, Nepal's contacts with and routes to the outer world were entirely through India and the remote Tibet region of China. From an undeveloped economy, more than 95 per cent agricultural, it had few items which could compe
te successfully in world markets. The only trading in volume has been the passage of local products both ways across the almost indistinguishable Indian frontier. 
\par Influences of the pas century appear to have had a predominantly retarding effect upon Nepal's commerce, especially our foreign trade. From the mid-19th to the mid 20th century, isolationism was national policy. 
Entrepot trade in that period was conducted mainly at the borders, with Nepalese buying at one frontier goods to be carried and sold at the other. 
This trade received a heavy setback when easier alternative routes into the Tibet region of China were developed through Kalimpong and Sikkim, and was further reduced on both sides of the northern boundary by obstructive tariffs and lawless inte
rference by local elements of the then Tibetan Government.

linked with a road which in turn connected with a ropeway and a trail to Kathmandu made a break in the capital's physical isolation. The Government meanwhile, has abandoned the previous policy of isolation. 
These developments might have presaged a rapid upsurge in trade with India and , through India, with overseas countries. They did make for a considerable increase in the imports of Kathmandu valley. The recent inauguration of air transport, 
serviced by the Indian Airlines Corporation, which links Kathmandu with India, on the one hand, and with a few interior centers on the on the other, has facilitated a dispersal of imports from India and beyond.

s internal and external trade. Transport and communications within the country are still severely limited. There is a shortage of information on potential trade channels and a dearth of statistics that might reveal past and present trends, 
as well as a continuing lack of more than a few commodities suitable for export. We have not had public and private commercial and banking institutions well adapted tot the promotion and support of trade. 
During the past several years financial instability has reduced willingness to initiate or expand trade ventures. Ad foreign trade relations - with India, China, and many other nations with whom Nepal has diplomatic relations \-
have not had the desirable foundation of a series of well-drawn treaties of commerce and friendship. 
\par Such a treaty with China, together with an improvement in transport facilities to the Tibetan border, would be a means to the restoration of our entrepot trade which could bean important aspect of our future commerce. 
But the most urgently needed negotiations is for a revision of our present treaty with India which affects both the bulk of our foreign trade, which is with India, and potentially significant overseas trade which must pass through India. 
\par The current treaty is now out-dated in its provisions relating to import and export tariffs, customs administration, the movements of goods in transit, and the administration of foreign exchange earnings. 
Formal agreement upon mutually acceptable terms governing the above and related matters could provide an important milestone in the growth of healthy commercial relations with India and with many overseas countries including Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, Japan
, European nations, the United Kingdom and the United States. It would also pave the way for well-constructed commercial treaties with these and other overseas countries.

Other measures are no less important and will be pressed during the early part of the Plan period in order that our commerce may benefit by, and contribute to, other aspects of our national development. Some are general measures, 
of primary concern to parts of the Government other than the Commerce Department but nevertheless of crucial importance to the growth of trade. These measures include the improvement and extension of transportation fa
cilities within the country and to our borders : the expansion of production from our farms, forests and industries : the stabilization of our currency and progress toward improved foreign exchange relationships : 
and the development of modernized institutions : public and private needed in the evolution of our structural trade relations. We need co-operatives, 
trade associations and other institutions through which marketing practices can be improved and its channels widened. We need trade promotion through publications and fairs and emporiums. 
Extended banking and credit and insurance facilities could do much to grease the wheel of commerce and add to its stability.

One of the principal functions of our expanding commerce is to build up the country's capacity to earn foreign exchange. For producers' goods- the implements and machinery of modern technological progress must usually be purchased largely from abroad. 
A country poor in foreign exchange resources may, at the present time, be able to make good the shortage by effective use of aid proffered by friendly nations. But such aid is not likely to continue, in volume, over a long period of time. 
It is important to build up some foreign exchange resources, and especially to expand the nation's capacity to earn foreign exchange, so that the country may stand more strongly 
\par on its own feet when outside assistance begins to taper off. There are two principal means whereby Nepal can develop its capacity to earn foreign exchange. One is to develop and expand the country's export industries. The Department of Commerce will co-
operate with the Departments of Industry, Agriculture and Forestry and with private business in analyzing the potentialities of 
\par external markets for out products, in providing guidance thereby to industries producing for export, and in developing contacts and channels needful in expanding the scope and volume of our export trade. 
The other principal means open t us for the acquisition of foreign exchange is tourism. This is a field in which

several departments of the Government will need to co-operate with each other and with non-governmental enterprises like travel bureaus, hotels, and guide services. 
For in order to build up tourism in Nepal it is necessary to disseminate widely in other lands information about the interests and attractions of the country, to build up travel facilities and modern hotel accommodations, 
to give information and provide guide services when desired, to make available the most appropriate products of Nepalese arts and crafts, to renovate points of major historic and cultural interest and, perhaps most, of all, 
to ensure full and satisfying opportunity to see, enjoy, and perhaps visit Nepal's matchless asset, the incomparable Himalayas with their flora, fauna, spas, lakes and waterfalls.

with the Ministry of Planning and Development on question of over all policy : with the State Bank on foreign exchange and related issues; and with all types of private organizations seeking in useful ways to foster the healthy growth of trade.

 miles south-west of Kathmandu, is 600 square miles in area. It has approximately 25,000 inhabitants and 25,000 bighas (nearly 42,000 acres) of land under cultivation. The valley contains, in addition, about 50,000
 additional bighas of fertile wasteland which can be brought under cultivation without damaging forest resources. The soil is suitable for growing cereals, pulses, sugarcane, oil-seeds, fruits and vegetables. 
Grassland is also available for cattle breeding. The surrounding forest, large and dense, abounds in high class timber resources for wood-working and derivative industries such as the manufacture of furniture, matches, paper, 
tanning materials and bamboo products. Ample raw materials also exist for other small or medium-size industries such as oil-milling, rice-milling cigarette production and lime and cement manufacture. 
\par Repeated attempts in the past to cultivate the valley's rich waste-land were thwarted by the deadly form of malaria which it is now possible, by modern methods, to control or eradicate. The conquest of malaria is the first major step toward the valley'
s development. The second is the building of roads and bridges. Concurrently, studies and surveys are needed to establish the potentialities of the area and its primary needs. 
\par Because of the possibilities of the area, especially for the production of food and the settlement and rehabilitation of poor and landless farmers, the Rapti Valley Multi-Purpose Development Project was recently initiated with the co-
operation and assistance of the United States aid mission in Nepal. The primary objectives of the Project are to produce enough food to satis
fy local requirements and provide in addition a surplus for food deficit areas in hill districts and Kathmandu Valley and, second to accommodate and give employment to poverty-stricken farm workers including flood refugees. Other aims, 
hardly less important, are to reduce the population in over\-crowded areas, to foster a range of local industries, to serve as a precedent and training ground for other comparable projects and to demonstrate the Government'
s determination to help the people in solving their most pressing economic problems. The project will also help to preserve various forms of wild life. And, in time, 
it should bring to the Government revenues which can be applied further development in the country. 
\par Development of the area has already begun with preliminary surveys and the initiation of malaria control work, road building and other activities. Plans have been drawn for a wide variety of developmental activities - such as construction of a 50
 mile road from Hitaura to Narayangarh, spraying of 400 villages against malaria, settlement of 25,000 people, breaking and putting into cultivation 50,000 bighas of land, establishing co-operative societies, schools and health services, 
setting up a variety of local industries, co-operating with the Village Development administration in building up local activities and extension services, building an air strip, and carrying out a cadastral survey.

been resorting increasingly to a shifting agriculture.\line 
\par The result is vicious circle. As grass and forest cover are removed to make way for agricultural plots, erosion \line increases rapidly, especially on the steeper inclines, carrying away valuable top soil. The resultant deterioration \line 
in cultivable land leads to further shifting in search of arable plots. The denuded hillsides, meanwhile, lose much \line of their moisture retaining capacity, in consequence of which landslides and floods of mounting severity occur, \line

A democratic government and a democratic way of life are based upon a enlightened citizenry; there can be little technological advancement without education. The improvement of economic conditions within 
the country is dependent upon knowledge of technology and an expanded programme in education. Because we have become a part of the world, we can no longer remain apart from it. 
To gain and hold a place in the world we must have a steady growth in education. 
\par Obstacles to growth and progress of education are numerous. Shortage of trained teaching personnel, shortage of schools and lack of a university for training our own personnel. Shortage of capital problems of reorganization within a new government, an e
xtremely inadequate transportation and communication system. An obsolete tax and land programme and a severe lack of facilities for health are but a few of the serious problems, which must be tackled and solved before progress can really manifest itself. 

\par The objectives of education are of course numerous. A few of the iong range objectives, which define characteristics of the proposed education plan, are not in themselves important. It is the implementation of these objectives, which will produce results
. Objectives as outlined in the National Education Commission Planning Report indicate the desires of the people in Nepal that education must be universal, it must be national, it must serve individual needs, and it must serve the people. 
In addition a plan for higher education and the education of adults must serve all those who desire growth in the many projected areas. 
\par In the area of elementary education, plans are already functioning. Teachers are being trained art the approximate rate of 400 per year; new schools are continually being opened by these new teachers: 
adult education has its ground work established in that each new teacher is prepared to organize and teach adult literacy classes. There are perhaps 15,000 more children in school now than there were 18 months ago.

At this point it must be realized that unless a statewide organization, which will being about a uniform school system in Nepal, is well established, education cannot spread. 
The evils of jealously amount the different types of schools and the lack of proper financial support could undo the progress made to date. Therefore, it is imperative that rapid progress be made in effective organization. A plan for finan
cing the schools is based on an estimated per pupil cost per year and will assure well trained teachers at all level must be considered a necessity if children are to receive a proper start in education. 
Just permitting anyone willing to teach to be a teacher in the elementary schools will defeat the total programme.

emphasized the need for a university programme for Nepal not only to train teachers but also to train leadership for agriculture, engineering projects, health and sanitation, in fact for every phase of the economic and cultured development of Nepal. 

\par Nepal now has the nucleus of the university in the following separately located and separately administered higher educational units:

The Nepal Education Planning Commission emphasized the importance of bringing these institutions together in a coordinate programme of higher education in order to enhance the quality 
to these institutions and to achieve economy in the utilization of personnel and equipment. 
\par In its conception of a university for Nepal, the Commission envisaged a comprehensive university embracing not only an Art and Science College, but the gradual development of the needed professional schools on the same campus. To carry out the Commission

The next under consideration in the development of a comprehensive University is the upgrading to a professional level of the School of Agriculture referred to in the following chapter, and the addition thereto of a department of Home Science, 
and ultimately a department of Forestry. Such a professional School of Agriculture should gradually incorporate an agricultural experiment station with suitable branch stations and the necessary research and service laboratories for soil and seed testing
, animal diagnostic services, etc.

A further step under current study is the advancement to university level of the School of Engineering discussed in the following chapter on training. Such a school might well continu

electrical, civil, and industrial engineering and in mining. In this school necessary non-duplicating laboratories would serve and help to integrate the work of

It has been said that a country cannot advance more rapidly than its people. As repeatedly stressed in earlier chapters, the most crucial problem confronting us in our attempt to achieve, within a few years, 
significant gains in economic and social development, is the lack of trained personnel-technical and administrative. Unless this problem is met with determination and vigor, there can be no possibility of success in attaining the goals of the Five- 
Year Plan. Training more than any other single factor will determine the rate at which plans can be translated into action. It is estimated that an average of at least 5 percent of each departmental budget over the five-year period will be spent 
for training, and that the percentage during the first two years will be much higher. Thus total expenditures for training will not be less than Rs. 1.66 cores (16.6 million) and the outlay required during the first year may be in the vicinity of Rs.80
 lakhs (8 millions).

Each participating department has made a preliminary assessment of its trained manpower requirements, in all categories, for the execution of the Five- Year Plan. The results, after making deductions for personnel now available are summarized below. 
Lower grade technicians may be defined as those who have received either diplomas in technical tra ining or other limited specialized training, while upper grade personnel, technical and administrative, may be defined as those who for the most part, 
have received degrees in their respective fields. The figures shown should be regarded as tentative and subject to considerable alteration in the light of further surveys and experience. REQUIREMENTS IN NEWLY TRAINED PERSONNEL Field Lower Grade Upper

It is expected that the school will be under the direction of a technical education board, and that expert counsel in its development will be provided from both multilateral and bilateral aid sources. In view of the shortage of technical teaching staff, 
officers in the Government who have received training in engineering subjects, and professors of science and mathematics in Tri-Chandra College, will be invited to undertake limited teaching loads. This

will be improved. Preliminary plans are being laid for the establishment, later, of a medical school as part of the new National University. 
\par In support of the education programme, two teacher training schools, already started, will be strengthened. One is for teachers in primary schools, the other for high school teachers.

road building ropeway construction, communications, industry, mining and resettlement. Some of these survey activities can be carried well forward within a year or two; some, like the cadastral survey will require years to complete. Once started, 
many types of surveys will become continuous activity, enabling both Government and private interests to keep currently well informed of progress and prospects in various aspects of the economy and in our economic life as a whole.

ropeways, power, irrigation and flood control projects. Such coordination is now being planned with the participation of the departments concerned. 
\par Of equal importance is the work that needs to be done in many fields of research. It is not necessary to duplicate the vast amount of fundamental research that has been done in other countries; 
we can borrow freely from the storehouses of basic and applied scientific knowledge. But there are types of information, necessary to the effective development of our economy, which can only be gained in Nepal, through research conducted here. 
As indicated in earlier chapters, research and experimentation are needed to determine the types of crops best suited to climatic and soil conditions in various parts of the country ; to analyse the soils of areas under 
consideration for reclamation and resettlement; to determine the quality and extent of forest fibers and many other types of raw materials ; to discover through essential to the planning of hydroelectric, irrigation and flood control projects; 
and to ascertain basic needs in health, education and many other fields. Research, in fact, is a continuous and unending process vital to economic growth, and its possible scope is unlimited 
\par The auspices under which research activities will be conducted will vary according to the subject matter and its relationship to various aspects of economic development. 
Certain studies of a specialized and immediately applicable character will be conducted by the Governmental departments concerned. Research of a more general or basic nature will emerge as part of the University programme now being planned. 
Consideration is also being given to the establishment of a central Scientific Research and Development Institute to serve all agencies to the Government requiring assistance in coping with scientific problems. 
Into such an Institute would be merged under unified, competent direction certain limited existing laboratories and physical research activities now receiving governmental support. Functioning within the Ministry of Planning and Development, 
or as an applied science department of the new National University, or as an independent agency of the Government, the Institute, as now conceived, will have an Advisory Board on which will be represented all of the technical agencies o
f the Government with direct interest in its work. Its activities would be related primarily to problems connected with some phase of economic development. When feasible, its services would be extended to private industry as well as government agencies. 
Among the objectives of the Institute would be: systematic studies of natural resources; analysis and testing of commercially important raw materials and other natural products: marketing studies: 
determinations of standards of quality for both raw materials and manufactured products: devising of means for more effective commercial exploitation of natural resources available in Nepal: serving as a source, upon request, 
of all kinds of available scientific information: and carrying out other similar functions related to any aspect of development.

From surveys and research will come an expansion in the kinds of statistical data that have become so important in modern times to both governments and private enterprise. A beginning has been made with the population census, 
and through it valuable experience and training have been acquired. It is now essential that the scope of statistical work be steadily broadened. It is proposed to establish a Central Statistical Office, with branch offices in appropriate localities, 
to conduct needed studies, in cooperation whenever possible with other governmental departments concerned; and to serve as a central repository of all kinds of statistical data derived from its own studies and those of other governmental statistical wo
rk will expand progressively to cover: vital statistics, health statistics: price movements; import and export statistics: meteorological records: 
and other types of quantitative data emerging from studies and surveys conducted by the Departments of Village Development, Agriculture, Industry, Mining, Transportation, Communications, Irrigation, Commerce, Finance, Education and Health.

From the Statistics Department and from all other agencies of the Government actively engaged in carrying forward programmes and projects under the Five-Year Plan will come a steady flow of information on the problems encountered and the progress achieved
. It is of the greatest importance that such information be shared fully and promptly with the people of the nation whose full understanding and participation are essential to the success of the Plan. 
Arrangements will be made to use all available channels of general communication, especially press and radio, but also special publication, exhibits, lectures and cinema to make sure that the Plan
